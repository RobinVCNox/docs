  <Step title="Get Authenticated">
    Our API uses API keys for authentication. Request your API key
    from our [support email: support@nox.energy](mailto:support@nox.energy) .

    <Note>
    More info in the [Authentication page](/api-reference/authentication).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call our API with your API Key">
    Use the API key in the header as follows:
    ```json
    x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
    Test if you have access with your API key by calling the [Get Devices endpoint](/api-reference/asset-info/get-devices).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Production ðŸš€">
    By default, you will have access to our Sandbox API for initial testing.
    When you are ready to transition to production, we would be pleased to schedule a
    meeting to discuss your specific integration requirements and work together
    to ensure a smooth deployment to our platform. Contact us at [support@nox.energy](mailto:support@nox.energy) .
