## Getting an API Key

If you want to be able to call our API's, you will need to request an API key
from our [support email: support@nox.energy](mailto:support@nox.energy) .

<Warning>
Make sure to keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
If it does get exposed. Contact us as quickly as possible.
</Warning>

## Using the API key

Include the API key in your API calls with the header:
```json
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

If you want to test the API using the UI of the documentation website, add it in the `x-api-key` field in
 the `Authorization` dropdown when you clicked on `Try it â–º`.  
Without a valid API key, your requests will be rejected.
