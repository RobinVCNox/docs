## Introduction

The NOX Energy API enables energy suppliers to seamlessly integrate residential energy assets
into their operations, supporting grid balancing and helping to optimize electricity costs
for end users. Through our secure, RESTful API, suppliers can access real-time, forecasted and historical data,
as well as control residential devices within their customer base.

Key capabilities include:

* Listing and managing device information
* Accessing historical and forecasted consumption data (per asset or aggregated)
* Retrieving household consumption forecasts
* Monitoring current flexibility (flex up/down) and executing flex actions across devices

Leverage the NOX Energy API to enhance your energy management strategies, improve grid stability,
and deliver greater value to your customers.

## API Environments

Nox Energy provides 2 seperated API environments:

Sandbox Base URL: [https://api.sandbox.nox.energy](/api-reference)  
Production Base URL: [https://api.nox.energy](/api-reference)

The Sandbox environment allows you to test and develop your integrations without affecting your live operations.
The sandbox API contains real-time generated test data to replicate our production environment as close as possible.
Our Historical sandbox endpoints hold between 7-30 days of data.
